COVID-19 is deadly and is very infectious type of disease in the recent time and it has shown the deadly nature of respiratory disease by effecting millions of lives across the globe . The Objective of this project is to detect the COVID-19 effected patients from Chest X-Ray images using CNN(Convolution Neural Network).Using Traditional RT-PCR methodology, it not only takes a lot of time but the results obtained may contain more false positive or false negative results. Therefore,Covid-19 screening can be adopted using X-Ray. It is a layered architecture, The sequential model will have conv2d layers followed by maxpooling, dropout, flattening, activation function as relu and optimiser as Adam. Finally it classifies whether it is covid positive or negative.
